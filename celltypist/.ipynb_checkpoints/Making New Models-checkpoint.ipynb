    "# Building New Models to Benchmark Against Celltypist\n",
    "In this notebook, I create and train several models based on/using the Celltypist model. I also train these models on a couple different data sets. These models are then tested on the data they were trained on, as well as others in the 'Benchmarking Models' notebook. \n",

    "### Order of Models: \n",
    "0. Train the basic CellTypist model on this data for easy comparison with other models later\n",
    "1. Remove the feature selection from CellTypist (so it only trains the model once)\n",
    "2. Train the model with L1 regularization instead of L2\n",
